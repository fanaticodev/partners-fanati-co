Infinite MLM:
1) Can your Board Plan module be integrated alongside the Binary Plan for position splitting?
Yes. We can customize running the Board (matrix/queue) and Binary plan modules in the same system and can integrate them so Board positions are created/split based on activity in the Binary tree.
Please let me how do you plan to work both structure? Is it like after a fixed numbers of binary position, the top member go to other board? Kindly explain the logical flow for this. So that we can program accordingly

2) Can the Board Plan auto-splitting feature be triggered by binary volume achievements?
Yes. It is customizable.  Board auto-splitting can be driven by Binary volume/points or pairing thresholds. *Please let me know the exact conditions for this.*

3) Can your token module handle admin-controlled balance-doubling events?

Yes possible with important governance & technical considerations. Actually we can do this in two implementation approaches:
a) On-platform ledger *(off-chain token):* admin action triggers a controlled ledger update that doubles balances in the platform token column. This is fast to implement but must include: multi-level admin approvals (multi-sig)
b) On-chain token (smart contract): doubling must be done by the token contract (mint + transfer or by a rebase mechanism). This is more transparent but requires smart-contract design (and possible redeploy/upgrade) and gas costs.

We can implement either approach — tell us whether you want an off-chain ledger update or an on-chain change and we’ll advise the exact design. Also Is token already developed or can we develop that as well?

4) Can your e-wallet be configured for automatic 60/40 commission splitting?
Yes. The e-wallet engine can be customised and its configurable automatic split rules. *Please let me know* what they can do with this separate ewallet, like shop or any other redeem they can do with this OR is it an admin reserve amount?

/home/sebastian/sites/partners.fanati.co/onecoin-mlm-technical-summary.md



1. the partners.fanati.co repo (https://github.com/fanaticodev/partners-fanati-co) will contain two repos:
1.1. Infinite MLM accessbile at partners.fanati.co
1.2. Hybrid MLM accessible at partners.fanati.co:port or partners.fanati.co/legacy

2. proceed to create the Monorepo for Infinite and Hybrid MLM using https://github.com/fanaticodev/partners-fanati-co




2. Local Development can be accessed via localhost addresses as fremont2 is a server. use sandbox.partners.fanati.co for developing and testing.
3. provide path for sandbox.partners.fanati.co for nginx configuration
